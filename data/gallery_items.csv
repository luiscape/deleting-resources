0,"Unplanned explosions at munitions sites (UEMS) are a significant safety concern for governments and a major security challenge for the international community. UEMS events have resulted in thousands of deaths, tens of thousands of injuries, hundreds of thousands of people being displaced, tens of millions of dollars of clean-up costs, and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars spent on replacement stocks. In some cases, the explosions have resulted in the arrest and removal of government ministers, civilian officials, and military officers.

Better and more complete information on each UEMS incident is needed to improve prevention efforts, and the Small Arms Survey has developed an Incident Reporting Template (IRT) to standardize and encourage the collating of information on such events. The UEMS Incident Reporting Template, a new Small Arms Survey Research Note, provides an overview of the IRT.

The IRT was developed as part of the Small Arms Survey’s forthcoming Handbook Unplanned Explosions at Munitions Sites (UEMS): Excess Stockpiles as Liabilities rather than Assets.

This product visualizes a regional humanitarian emergency, as well as dividing it into four distinct but overlapping theaters: Northern Syria and Turkey, Western Syria and Lebanon, Southern Syria and Jordan, and Eastern Syria and Iraq. Each regional theater highlights areas of influence of the Asad regime, ISIL, Jabhat-al-Nusra, Kurdish elements, and moderate opposition groups as well as contested areas. Areas of influence are current for Iraq as of August 20, 2014, and current for Syria as of September 5, 2014. The map also details key events in the conflict and provides information on displacement of affected populations both internally and into surrounding countries.

Tools and services allow data extracts for GIS specialists, Routable Garmin GPS data, Smartphone GPS navigation, and other device-compatible downloads. With an internet connection, regular syncing is possible with open access to the community contributed data as it comes in, with OpenStreetMap's bulk data downloads ideal for use offline.
